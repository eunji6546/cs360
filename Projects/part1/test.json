MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE KARAOKE VCD ON YOUR PLAYER: About Video CD... What is a Video Compact Disc or VCD ? A Video Compact Disc or VCD is a compact disc that plays movies instead of music only. It is in multi-platform format which means you can use many different kinds of equipment to play them, such as most of the DVD players with Vcd (MPEG-1 format) playing capability. VCDs look exactly like a CD or CD-ROM except that it stores video/audio clips using the compressed and standardized MPEG-1 (Motion Picture Expert Group) format. It was jointly developed by Philips and Sony and were introduced in 1993. A single disc can hold 74 minutes of video but usually only 50 to 60 minutes is actually used. How to play Karaoke (Sing Along music) from a Video Compact Disc or VCD ? In your computer, VCD, most DVD or other players, you will be able to see and listen to both movie and music, by default. This is similar to watching and enjoying an MTV on the display screen. You can adjust the audio setting to either left, middle or right, from the computer player program audio setting, or the remote control of your Vcd or DVD player. Left audio channel: This is normally the movie with background music but without SINGER to sing. Now you can begin to enjoy the magic of karaoke and sing along with the background music (by using a connected microphone to a stereo system). You will be able to read the dynamic LYRICS of the song from the display screen, which will guide you thorough the whole song. Middle (Stereo) audio channel: This is a stereo setting where you can enjoy the whole music performance by another artist. Listen to how this artist performing this song, and later you can play the song again and adjust the audio to left channel and sing along by yourself. Sing like a superstar. Right audio channel: This is an audio setting similar to middle audio channel, by normally the singer's sound is higher in volume. Both singer's vocal and background music can be listened. Lyrics and background movie are displayed in all audio channels. Why is VCD gaining popularity in America, Europe and Australia ? VCDs are very popular in Asia and are gaining popularity in America, Europe and Australia. Nowadays, VCDs have practically replaced video cassettes in Asia. The main reason is because VCD is cheap compared to DVDs and the quality is even better than VHS.

DVD movies are encoded using a compression technique called MPEG-2. Whereas, VCDs are encoded in MPEG-1. Because of the similarity of encoding/ compression technique, most, but not all DVD players can play VCD and DVD. For example, SONY DVP-S3000 and SONY DVP-S7000 and PIONEER DVD PLAYER DV-505.
